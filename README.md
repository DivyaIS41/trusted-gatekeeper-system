# The Trusted Gatekeeper System

## Overview
The Trusted Gatekeeper System is a Zero-Trust secure communication framework designed for IoT–Fog–Cloud environments.  
It ensures that data generated by devices reaches the cloud only after passing through a fog-level security gateway that verifies, inspects, and filters all communication.

## Core Idea
No device or message is trusted by default.  
Every interaction is verified at the fog layer before being forwarded to the cloud.

## System Components
- IoT Device (data source)
- Fog Gateway (security enforcement point)
- Cloud Server (trusted data storage)
- Crypto Module (shared security logic)
- Attack Module (security validation)

## Project Stages
- Stage A: Basic Communication
- Stage B: Encrypted Communication
- Stage C: Device Identity & Zero Trust
- Stage D: Attack Simulation & Detection
- Stage E: Logging, Reports & Enhancements

## Goal
To demonstrate a practical, attack-resilient, Zero-Trust communication system using a clear, modular, and deployable architecture.
